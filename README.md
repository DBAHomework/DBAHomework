# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan – Creative Technologist in Training

I'm a systems-thinking artist, goldsmith, and self-taught technologist building a career at the intersection of AI, Web3, documentation, and accessible tooling. I’m most excited about helping creators, collectors, and curious thinkers navigate emerging technologies through thoughtful UX, ethical automation, and creative workflows.

Right now I’m learning in public as I build:

- 🧰 **Prompt Toolkit** – reusable, modular prompts for ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs
- 🧠 **SystemKit** – a structured Obsidian vault and prompt system for managing tools, tasks, and projects
- 🌐 **CreatorNetwork** – an experimental social-web project for creative scavenger hunts, geocaching, and marketplace interactions (built with no-code + HTML/CSS/JS)
- 🔄 **LLM Workflow Experiments** – exploring how to pair models like GPT + Claude to build multi-agent creative systems

## 🧭 Background

- 🎓 BFA in Art (Jewelry), former studio monitor & library assistant
- 🔍 Passion for structured thinking, documentation, and UX that empowers
- 🧠 Diagnosed ADHD, possibly Autistic – I’m especially interested in neurodivergent-friendly tools and workspaces
- 📚 Learning tools: Obsidian, GitHub, Bubble, Claude, ChatGPT, Markdown, APIs, Homebrew, and Webflow

## 🚀 Goals

- Land a paid role in AI, Web3, documentation, or dev support
- Build tools that help non-coders think, learn, and create like technologists
- Learn full-stack and agent workflows by building from the ground up
- Connect with mentors, teammates, and mission-aligned collaborators
